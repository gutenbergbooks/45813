OF

LIFE AND CHARACTER.]

[Illustration: _HISTORY.--THE ANCIENT BRITONS._

_Emily (reads)._ "IN THE SUMMER THEY WERE NAKED, AND INSTEAD OF
CLOTHES THEY PUT PAINT UPON THEIR BODIES. THEY WERE FOND OF A FINE
BLUE COLOUR, WHICH THEY MADE OF A PLANT CALLED WOAD, WHICH THEY FOUND
IN THEIR WOODS. THEY SQUEEZED OUT THE JUICE OF THE WOAD, AND THEN
STAINED THEMSELVES ALL OVER WITH IT, SO THAT IN SUMMER THEY LOOKED AS
IF THEY WERE DRESSED IN TIGHT BLUE CLOTHES."

WILKINS, WHY DIDN'T YOU FORWARD THESE LETTERS? THEY ARE OF THE UTMOST

delicious, you know!"]

[Illustration: _SEVERE._

_Old Lady._ "Ah thin, bad luck to ye, Grigory! Where's your manners?

soft, and the tentacles are of the finest violet, mingled often with
pink, mauve, green, and yellow; indeed the colours vary so much in
different individuals, all alike beautiful, that it is impossible
to describe them rigidly. * * * During the ebb of the tide, these
creatures may be contemplated on a fine day to great advantage, and

AWAY WE WENT AS HARD AS WE COULD SPLIT, OVER SIMMONS' ENCLOSURES--INTO
BROADFIELD PARK--RIGHT THROUGH OLD LADY GOLLOP'S GARDEN--YOU NEVER
SAW SUCH A SIGHT--DIDN'T STOP THERE, BUT STEAMED AWAY DOWN FRESHWATER
VALE, AND KILLED HIM IN THE OPEN, CLOSE TO DOLLMAN'S HEATH--AN HOUR
AND TEN MINUTES BY MY LITTLE WATCH, AND CHARLEY BANGOROFT SAYS I WENT

INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S TWO MEN BEHIND THE CARRIDGE!" (_Poor
Fellow!_)]

[Illustration: _ACCEPTING A SITUATION._
